### **Farming Bar**

Action bar to display and track farming objectives.

#### **Inspiration**

Farming Bar was inspired by [FarmIt](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/farmit) with the goal of improvement and maintenance. Be sure to explore the new interface and settings to familiarize yourself with any changes and new features.

#### **Features**

-   Create an unlimited number of bars and drag items onto them in order to track your inventory.
-   Set farming objectives that can be tracked through personalized alerts.
-   Create complex farming objectives, allowing you to track multiple items and currencies.
-   Adjust your bar settings with an easy to use interface. This means you don't have to use the chat commands unless you _want_ to.

You can access the configuration interface by right-clicking any bar's anchor button. You can also open the main interface using _/farmingbar show_.
