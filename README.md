### **Farming Bar**
Action bar to display and track farming objectives.

#### **Inspiration**
Farming Bar was inspired by [FarmIt](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/farmit) with the goal of improvement and maintenance. Be sure to explore the new interface and settings to familiarize yourself with any changes and new features.

#### **Features**
* Create an unlimited number of bars, which you can drag items onto in order to track your inventory.
* Set farming objectives which can be tracked through personalized alerts.
* Create complex objectives allowing you to track multiple items as mixed items objectives or shopping lists.
* Adjust your bar settings with an easy to use interface. That means you don't have to use the chat commands unless you *want* to.

You can access the configuration interface by shift+right-clicking any bar's anchor button. You can also open the main interface using */farmingbar* or  */farmingbar help*.
